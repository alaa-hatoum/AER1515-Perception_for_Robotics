### Installation
# To install the required environment for assignment 1, a standard way is to use the following commands:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# This will, by default, install a CPU version of PyTorch. For students with a good NVIDIA GP, you are welcome to install a GPU version of PyTorch .



### Training
# To train the binary classifier with the provided start code, you need to change the working directory to "AER1515_Assignment1/code/", and run "train.py".
# When the training is done, the program should generate a file called "model.pt" and show a plot of the training loss curve.



### Testing
# To test the trained CNN model, you need to run "test.py". The classification accuracy will be reported.



### Dataset
# All the training and testing data are included in the working directory of "AER1515_Assignment1/AnimalFace/".
